\usage{
dfa_filter(
  horizon = 6,
  degree = 0,
  density = c("uniform", "rw"),
  targetfilter = lp_filter(horizon = horizon)[, 1],
  passband = 2 * pi/12,
  accuracy.weight = 1/3,
  smoothness.weight = 1/3,
  timeliness.weight = 1/3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{horizon}{horizon (bandwidth) of the symmetric filter.}

\item{degree}{degree of polynomial.}

\item{density}{hypothesis on the spectral density: \code{"uniform"} (= white woise, the default) or  \code{"rw"} (= random walk).}

\item{targetfilter}{the weights of the symmetric target filters (by default the Henderson filter).}

\item{passband}{passband threshold.}

\item{accuracy.weight, smoothness.weight, timeliness.weight}{the weight used for the
optimisation. The weight associated to the residual is derived so that the sum of
the four weights are equal to 1.}
