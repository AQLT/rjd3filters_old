\title{Simple Moving Average}
\usage{
simple_ma(order, lags = -trunc((order - 1)/2))
}
\arguments{
\item{order}{number of terms of the moving_average}

\item{lags}{integer indicating the number of lags of the moving average.}
}
\description{
A simple moving average is a moving average whose coefficients are all equal and whose sum is 1
}
\examples{
# The M2X12 moving average is computed as
(simple_ma(12, -6) + simple_ma(12, -5)) / 2
# The M3X3 moving average is computed as
simple_ma(3, -1) ^ 2
# The M3X5 moving average is computed as
simple_ma(3, -1) * simple_ma(5, -2)
}
