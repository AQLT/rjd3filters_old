\title{Accuracy/smoothness/timeliness criteria through spectral decomposition}
\usage{
mse(sweights, aweights, density = c("uniform", "rw"), passband = pi/6)
}
\arguments{
\item{sweights}{Weights of the symmetric filter (from 0 to n or -n to n).}

\item{aweights}{Weights of the asymmetric filter (from -n to m).}

\item{density}{hypothesis on the spectral density: \code{"uniform"} (= white woise, the default) or  \code{"rw"} (= random walk).}

\item{passband}{passband threshold.}
}
\value{
The criteria
