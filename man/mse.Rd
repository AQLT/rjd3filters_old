\usage{
mse(sweights, aweights, density = c("rw", "uniform"), passband = pi/6)

\arguments{
\item{sweights}{Weights of the symmetric filter (from 0 to n or -n to n).}

\item{aweights}{Weights of the asymmetric filter (from -n to m)}

\item{density}{hypothesis on the spectral density}

\item{passband}{passband threshold}
