\title{Optimization Function of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) Filters}
\usage{
rkhs_optimization_fun(
  horizon = 6,
  leads = 0,
  degree = 2,
  kernel = c("Biweight", "Henderson", "Epanechnikov", "Triangular", "Uniform",
    "Triweight"),
  asymmetricCriterion = c("Timeliness", "FrequencyResponse", "Accuracy", "Smoothness"),
  density = c("uniform", "rw"),
  passband = 2 * pi/12
)
}
\arguments{
\item{horizon}{horizon (bandwidth) of the symmetric filter.}

\item{leads}{Leads of the filter (should be positive or 0).}

\item{degree}{degree of polynomial.}

\item{kernel}{kernel uses.}

\item{asymmetricCriterion}{the criteria used to compute the optimal bandwidth. If \code{"Undefined"}, \eqn{m+1} is used.}

\item{density}{hypothesis on the spectral density: \code{"uniform"} (= white woise, the default) or  \code{"rw"} (= random walk).}

\item{passband}{passband threshold.}
