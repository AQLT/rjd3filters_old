\title{Linear Filtering on a Time Series}
\usage{
jfilter(y, coefs, remove_missing = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a univariate or multivariate time series.}

\item{coefs}{a \code{matrix} or a \code{list} that contains all the coefficients of the asymmetric and symmetric filters.
(from the symmetric filter to the shortest). See details.}

\item{remove_missing}{if \code{TRUE} (default) leading and trailing NA are removed before filtering.}
}
\description{
Applies linear filtering to a univariate time series or to each series separately of a multivariate time series using either a moving average (symmetric or asymmetric) or a combination of
symmetric moving average at the center and asymmetric moving averages at the bounds.
}
\details{
The functions \code{jfilter} extends \code{\link[stats]{filter}} allowing to apply every kind of moving averages
(symmetric and asymmetric filters) or to apply aset multiple moving averages
to deal with the boundaries.

Let \eqn{x_t} be the input time series to filter.
\itemize{
\item If \code{coef} is an object \code{\link[=moving_average]{moving_average()}}, of length \eqn{q}, the result \eqn{y} is equal at time \eqn{t} to:
\deqn{y[t] = x[t-lags] * coef[1] + x[t-lags+1] * coef[1] + ... + x[t-lags+q] * coef[q]}.
It extends the function \code{\link[stats]{filter}} that would add \code{NA} at the end of the time series.
\item If \code{coef} is a \code{matrix}, \code{list} or \code{\link[=finite_filters]{finite_filters()}} object,  at the center,
the symmetric moving average is used (first column/element of \code{coefs}).
At the boundaries, the last moving average of \code{coefs} is used to compute the filtered
time series \eqn{y[n]} (no future point known), the second to last to compute the filtered
time series \eqn{y[n-1]} (one future point known)...

y <- retailsa$DrinkingPlaces

lags <- 6
leads <- 2
fst_coef <- fst_filter(lags = lags, leads = leads, smoothness.weight = 0.3, timeliness.weight = 0.3)
lpp_coef <- lp_filter(horizon = lags, kernel = "Henderson", endpoints = "LC")

fst_ma <- jfilter(y, fst_coef)
lpp_ma <- jfilter(y, lpp_coef[,"q=2"])

plot(ts.union(y, fst_ma, lpp_ma), plot.type = "single", col = c("black","red","blue"))

trend <- jfilter(y, lpp_coef)
# This is equivalent to:
trend <- localpolynomials(y, horizon = 6)
